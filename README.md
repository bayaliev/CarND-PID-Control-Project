Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Effects each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.
I have tried different PID coefficients and observed their influence how stable car behaves.
P as its name implies (proportional) coeeficient was responsible for compensating current steering error.
For example if P coefficient was high the car would swing from left to right, and that make sense because it tries to compensate the current steering error very hard (since Kp is high) and overshoots the target. So it was important to choose Kp not too high but also resonably low so that the control algorithm could respond to immediate changes in the error.

I (integral) component was accumulating the error over time and it made a very big impact on the control since the cumulative error would get to high. So i have decided to choose Ki as 0 so that it would not have any effect on the controller.

D (derivate) component really helped where P component would overshoot the target. Kd is resposible for the rate of change in the error and had knowledge about the error over time. So basically when i made Kd component higher the controller would make the steering more smooth and react to changes slowly and compensate them at the same time.

## Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen. (Manual tuning)
At the beggining i started by using only P component and i saw that higher values would swing the car and lower values would not even make first turn. So i understood that -0.5 is to high bu -0.1 is too low. But to come up with final Kp value i had to try I and D components and see how they work altogether.
Whatever the values i chose for I component it did not help and i decided to keep it 0 at this time.
The D component was choosen to be -0.5 with same P value but it the car kept swinging left and right. That way i understood that P component is too high. So i have gradually lowered P component to -0.15 while increasing D component to -0.85 and got the car going the complete lap with the kP = -0.15, kI = 0, kD = -0.85.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
